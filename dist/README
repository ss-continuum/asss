Hi. This is a beta release of asss (it stands for "a small subspace
server"). If you have any questions or comments, mail them to
grelminar@yahoo.com.

Most of the documentation is available in the user guide, in directory
"doc". You might want to read it before you try playing with this.

To start using this thing, make sure you're in the root directory of
this distribution (the directory that this file is in), and run
"bin/asss". You might want to run it in a screen session so it can be
detached easily. Or you can run "bin/asss -d" to make it fork into the
background.

You can close it with the sysop command ?shutdown, or just with a
Ctrl-C. The Ctrl-C isn't a clean shutdown, so you risk losing some data.

Note the presence of several empty directories: log, data, and tmp.
Don't remove any of them, the server needs them to be there to create
files in.


If you want to connect to a billing server: Since there are no existing
billing servers that support the new billing protocol that I made,
you'll have to use the bproxy thingy that translates between the new and
old protocols. Set Billing:Proxy in global.conf to the path of the
bproxy script (in the scripts dir). Set the rest of the settings (IP,
Port, ServerName, Password) in Billing as appropriate. You'll need a
relatively recent version of Python (2.1+ should work).



Known bugs:

billing server support isn't well tested.
a few things are missing from the billing interface (like banners).
