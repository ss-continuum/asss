
Welcome to asss (a small subspace server) 0.5

This news.txt will be used for updates about new features and other important
information. I have my own internal to-do list apart from this file. If you
have any suggestions of any kind, please let me know.


Recent updates:
    * cleanups in the freq management. it was split off into a separate
        module, and can now be replaced per-arena. also added hooks for
        setting freqs/ships.

    * bricks!

    * energy/inventory info (including energy-viewing for team only)

    * capability manager that uses user-definable groups to allow access
        to commands and other things.

    * balls! (preliminary goal handling)

    * flags! (with correct flag-kill handling, and victories)

    * mapdata module
        keeps entire maps in memory in only around 200k per map.
        also manages named regions (which are only used for the
        autowarper so far).


High-level to-do list:
    * come up with better interface to other languages (python, and others)

    * latency/ploss handling and security

    * more commands
