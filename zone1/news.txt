This news.txt will be used for updates about new features and other important
information. I have my own internal to-do list apart from this file. If you
have any suggestions of any kind, please let me know.


Recent updates:
    * energy/inventory info (including energy-viewing for team only)

    * capability manager that uses user-definable groups to allow access
        to commands and other things.

    * balls! (no goals, though)

    * flags! (with correct flag-kill handling, and victories)

    * mapdata module mostly written
        it uses a cool sparse array structure to save memory but retain
        really fast access speed. an average .lvl file takes just 200k.


High-level to-do list:
    * come up with better interface to other languages (python, and others)

    * latency/ploss handling and security

    * more commands



random line to force redownloading:
