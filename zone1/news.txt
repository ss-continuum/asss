
Welcome to asss (a small subspace server) 0.2

I've proven that it can send a news.txt to players, so I'm going to be using
this file for updates and other important information.

If you're playing on here, please help me test by trying out different
combinations of everything and telling me if anything works different
than subgame. Even slightly differently. Even if it just _feels_ funny,
tell me. It might mean I'm doing something differently.


Recent updates:
    * put all packet structs in src/packets

    * put #ifndef/#endif around all header files

    * redid module loading on startup to be simpler

    * rewrote config file crap. it even has #include now.


Current bugs/ugliness:

    * it blocks on compressing .lvl files. this isn't a big deal on my p800
        with a few people on at a time, but it must get fixed eventually.

    * there's quite a bit of restrictions on the order stuff loads in. the new
        internal design should help, but i'd like to clean this up even more

    * unknown bug in module unloading that sometimes crashes on shutdown. in
        general, module unloading is not as clean as i'd like it to be.

    * the network layer currently relies on some data from players[], which
        means i can't use the exact same module to serve a billing server,
        which i'd like to do eventually.




Stuff it does now:
    * logging on and entering arenas
    * map/news downloads
    * chat: pub, priv (same arena only), team, nme team,
        mod (start messages with a backslash: '\')
    * changing ship and freq
    * changing arena (test this a lot)
    * green relaying
    * deaths
    * positions/weapons
        this means you can actually play a game!
        my routing is probably not as good as real subgame yet
        then again, it might be better
        I've come to realize that JeffP didn't really know what
        he was doing when he wrote this part
        (test this a lot too)
    * speccing people (test this)
    * player counts on port+1
    * encryption (disabled most of the time, though)
    * some commands (?arena, ?logon, ?setop, ?shutdown)
        note that my command structure is very different from subgame
        the most important difference is that there is no longer a difference
        between ? and *. both work for all commands, and all commands are
        logged
    * some mod structure: you can assign people oplevels, or use passwords
        staff log on by default with no powers, you need to type ?logon to
        enable them. you can also get rid of them by typing ?logon 0 or any
        text that isn't a password.



Stuff it will do soon:
    * use hash for incoming packets
    * bricks
    * banners
    * client-side settings



Stuff it will probably do in a long time:
    * everything involving billing server:
        ?chat channels
        scores
        squads
        authentication
    * buffering and late-sending of weapons packets (?)
    * flags
    * balls
    * lag stuff:
        calculation of lag in an intelligent way
        varying penalties (dropping weapons, forcing to spec, etc)
    * security checksums
    * other security enhancements (there's a lot to do here)
    * run ekted's bots internally (not so hard, but useless without flags/balls first)
    * use the same core code and modules to be a billing server too



Fun stuff it might do if I feel like it: (no protocol modifications)
    * server-side version of minewriter
    * bricklayer: minewriter with bricks
    * dynamicly generated news.txt
        (not sure if this is useful... maybe include extra info for staff?)
    * player-to-player file transfer (should be possible with the current client)
    * integrated game recorder/player (will put ssvcr to shame :)
    * working chess player with 32 real ships
    * implement ?buy, but much more flexible. it should be possible to
        set up an RPG-type zone where you keep upgrades across deaths
        and earn money you can purchase upgrades with, etc.



Really cool stuff that's only possible with protocol modifications:
    * configurable spawn points and forcing into arenas, enabling
        multi-arena" maps where going to a specific area in one map would warp
        you to some other area on another map.
    * more possibilities with doors
    * much more I can't think of at the moment



Stuff it will do only if people request it:
    * ads
    * lots of subgame features that aren't really used
