
Welcome to asss (a small subspace server) 0.4

This news.txt will be used for updates about new features and other important
information. I have my own internal to-do list apart from this file. If you
have any suggestions of any kind, please let me know.


Recent updates:
    * flags! (with correct flag-kill handling, and victories)

    * mapdata module mostly written
        it uses a cool sparse array structure to save memory but retain
        really fast access speed. an average .lvl file takes just 200k.

    * updates to logging system: better priorities, consistent format


High-level to-do list:
    * balls

    * better authority model (groups, capabilities)

    * come up with better interface to other languages (python, and others)

    * latency/ploss handling and security

    * more commands


Stuff it does now:
    * logging on and entering arenas
    * map/news downloads
    * chat: pub, priv (same arena only), team, nme team,
        mod (start messages with a backslash)
    * changing ship and freq
    * changing arena (test this a lot)
    * green relaying
    * deaths
    * positions/weapons
    * speccing people (test this)
    * player counts on port+1
    * encryption (disabled most of the time, though)
    * some commands (?arena, ?login, ?setop, ?shutdown)
        note that my command structure is very different from subgame
        the most important difference is that there is no longer a difference
        between ? and *. both work for all commands, and all commands are
        logged
    * some mod structure: you can assign people oplevels, or use passwords
        staff log on by default with no powers, you need to type ?login to
        enable them. you can also get rid of them by typing ?login 0 or any
        text that isn't a password.
