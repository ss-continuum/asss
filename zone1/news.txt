
Welcome to asss (a small subspace server) 0.3

This news.txt will be used for updates about new features and other important
information. I have my own internal to-do list apart from this file. If you
have any suggestions of any kind, please let me know.


Recent updates:
    * totally recreated player status system, login processing, and arena
      management. this should make it much more robust and extendable.

    * along with player status system, made things multithreaded and put a lot
      of processing in separate threads.

	* some work on clientset and scoreman. it should soon be possible to use
      server.cfg files on here.


High-level to-do list:
    * work on more modules, in roughly this order:
        clientset, scoreman, game/flag/ball, etc.

    * better authority model (groups, capabilities)

    * come up with better interface to other languages (python, and others)

    * latency/ploss handling


Stuff it does now:
    * logging on and entering arenas
    * map/news downloads
    * chat: pub, priv (same arena only), team, nme team,
        mod (start messages with a backslash: '\')
    * changing ship and freq
    * changing arena (test this a lot)
    * green relaying
    * deaths
    * positions/weapons
    * speccing people (test this)
    * player counts on port+1
    * encryption (disabled most of the time, though)
    * some commands (?arena, ?logon, ?setop, ?shutdown)
        note that my command structure is very different from subgame
        the most important difference is that there is no longer a difference
        between ? and *. both work for all commands, and all commands are
        logged
    * some mod structure: you can assign people oplevels, or use passwords
        staff log on by default with no powers, you need to type ?logon to
        enable them. you can also get rid of them by typing ?logon 0 or any
        text that isn't a password.


Fun stuff it might do if I feel like it: (no protocol modifications)
    * server-side version of minewriter
    * bricklayer: minewriter with bricks
    * dynamicly generated news.txt
        (not sure if this is useful... maybe include extra info for staff?)
    * player-to-player file transfer (should be possible with the current client)
    * integrated game recorder/player
    * working chess player with 32 real ships
    * implement ?buy, but much more flexible. it should be possible to
        set up an RPG-type zone where you keep upgrades across deaths
        and earn money you can purchase upgrades with, etc.


Really cool stuff that's only possible with protocol modifications:
    * configurable spawn points and forcing into arenas, enabling
        multi-arena" maps where going to a specific area in one map would warp
        you to some other area on another map.
    * more possibilities with doors
    * much more I can't think of at the moment


Stuff it will do only if people request it:
    * ads
    * lots of subgame features that aren't really used
