
Welcome to asss (a small subspace server) 0.3

This news.txt will be used for updates about new features and other important
information. I have my own internal to-do list apart from this file. If you
have any suggestions of any kind, please let me know.


Recent updates:
    * tons and tons of bugfixes

    * totally recreated player status system, login processing, and arena
      management. this should make it much more robust and extendable.

    * along with player status system, made things multithreaded and put a lot
      of processing in separate threads.

	* some work on clientset and scoreman. it is now possible to use
	  server.cfg files on here.


High-level to-do list:
    * work on more modules

    * better authority model (groups, capabilities)

    * come up with better interface to other languages (python, and others)

    * latency/ploss handling and security


Stuff it does now:
    * logging on and entering arenas
    * map/news downloads
    * chat: pub, priv (same arena only), team, nme team,
        mod (start messages with a backslash: '\')
    * changing ship and freq
    * changing arena (test this a lot)
    * green relaying
    * deaths
    * positions/weapons
    * speccing people (test this)
    * player counts on port+1
    * encryption (disabled most of the time, though)
    * some commands (?arena, ?logon, ?setop, ?shutdown)
        note that my command structure is very different from subgame
        the most important difference is that there is no longer a difference
        between ? and *. both work for all commands, and all commands are
        logged
    * some mod structure: you can assign people oplevels, or use passwords
        staff log on by default with no powers, you need to type ?logon to
        enable them. you can also get rid of them by typing ?logon 0 or any
        text that isn't a password.
