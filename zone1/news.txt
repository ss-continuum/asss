
Welcome to asss (a small subspace server) 0.5.2

This news.txt will be used for updates about new features and other important
information. I have my own internal to-do list apart from this file. If you
have any suggestions of any kind, please let me know.


Recent updates:
    * multiple commands on the same line (separate with |'s)

    * autoturrets - drop one with ?dropturret. this is based on a helper
      module that will make other "fake player" based stuff easier.

    * client->server weapons checksums - these are actually checked now :)

    * per-arena interfaces - this is purely internal stuff that should
      simplify a bunch of code

    * named and properly refcounted interfaces - more internal stuff
      that will enable nicer delegation between modules

    * progress on a stub generator and supporting code that will enable
      modules to run in another process or on another machine, with no
      changes to their source.
