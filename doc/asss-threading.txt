new threading model for asss (TENATIVE!)
----------------------------------------

some new ideas:

buffer lists are maintained as doubly linked circular linked lists
there is a free list, a reliable list, and an outgoing list

recv thread:
	recieves packets with recvfrom
	if they are unreliable, process them in place.
	if not, process them with one of the oohandlers
		if the oohandlers come up with a packet to process (03, 09, 0A,
		0E), they will add it to the reliable list or process it in
		place.

send thread:
	scan list, looking for packets that need to be sent/resent and send
	them. also free buffers for outgoing packets whose target players
	have disappeared.

reliable thread:
	scan reliable list and find packets that are ready to be processed
	process them

outgoing packets:
	all of the send functions will put packets onto the outgoing list
	scan out list and 


locks:
	there's one lock for each of the big lists

FIXME: think about locks a lot!
