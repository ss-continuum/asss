the format of the config files is very flexible
here are some examples:


standard windows ini:

[Foo]
Bar=Baz


weirdo style:
 
   {{{  Foo   }}}
   Key  ===   Val


quasi-C style:
 
{   NewSection
        Key = Value
        Key2 = Value
}


not to mention the ability to load other config managers, even ones that get
configuration info out of a database. that's quite powerful.
