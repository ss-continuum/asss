	<h2>a small subspace server</h2>

	<p>
	asss is a server for the game <a href="http://www.subspacehq.com/">subspace</a>.
	It has lots more features than the current server in use. It is
	primarily developed on Linux, but also runs on other unix-like
	systems, and at times, Windows.

	<ul>
		<li>1.0rc2: Just a few minor fixes here. Probably the most
		important is to the directory module: it now supports multiple
		listening ports and a few bugs were fixed. Also, there are
		binaries for freebsd included this time, plus a little patch to
		help you compile it on your own.

		<li>1.0rc1: This is the first of hopefully few release
		candidates for version 1.0. What's so special about 1.0?
		Nothing, really. It's just a nice round number, and I wanted to
		wait until all the core features were basically complete before
		calling something 1.0. Anyway, please test this and let me know
		about any urgent bugs. I'd like to have 1.0 be something stable
		so I can start adding crazy new features soon.

		<li>Here's 0.9.13: A lot of bugs have been fixed, and there's
		some new stuff. Continuum 0.38 is required to connect to it
		(there's nothing in the code requiring that, it's just that I
		turned on the packet crc check and 0.37 doesn't send correct
		crcs, so it can't connect).
