	<h2>a small subspace server</h2>

	<p>
	asss is a server for the game <a href="http://www.subspacehq.com/">subspace</a>.
	It has lots more features than the current server in use. It is
	primarily developed on Linux, but also runs on other unix-like
	systems, and at times, Windows.

		<li>November 21, 2003 - 1.1.6: A new release. Lots of fixes, and
		some small new features. Yeah, the version number jumped a bit
		since it's been so long. I'm going to try to get something to
		take my (somewhat) detailed change logs from CVS and post them
		here.

		<li>September 18, 2003 - 1.1.3: Fixed a big bug, added
		?recyclearena, other tiny changes.

		<li>September 10, 2003 - 1.1.2: Sorry it's been so long. This update
		has a lot of bug fixes, a few new or fixed commands, a bunch of
		new ccc features (for all 4 of you who use it), and the
		beginnings of a developer guide.

		<li>July 27, 2003 - 1.1.0: I'm going to start adopting the convention
		that even minor version numbers mean stable releases, and odd
		minor version numbers mean unstable development releases. I
		fixed a few things and have something to call a final 1.0. I've
		also been working on new experimental stuff, and I'm releasing
		that as 1.1.0 now. So if you'd like to try the latest crazy
		stuff, try that. If you want something that might be a little
		more stable, try 1.0 (I did backport a bunch of fixes that I
		made between 1.0rc2 and 1.1.0 to 1.0).

		<li>1.0rc2: Just a few minor fixes here. Probably the most
		important is to the directory module: it now supports multiple
		listening ports and a few bugs were fixed. Also, there are
		binaries for freebsd included this time, plus a little patch to
		help you compile it on your own.

		<li>1.0rc1: This is the first of hopefully few release
		candidates for version 1.0. What's so special about 1.0?
		Nothing, really. It's just a nice round number, and I wanted to
		wait until all the core features were basically complete before
		calling something 1.0. Anyway, please test this and let me know
		about any urgent bugs. I'd like to have 1.0 be something stable
		so I can start adding crazy new features soon.

		<li>Here's 0.9.13: A lot of bugs have been fixed, and there's
		some new stuff. Continuum 0.38 is required to connect to it
		(there's nothing in the code requiring that, it's just that I
		turned on the packet crc check and 0.37 doesn't send correct
		crcs, so it can't connect).
