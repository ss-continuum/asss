better pre-processor for config

locking. lots of options here:
	lock to freq
	lock to ship
	lock only certain people
	finite "lives" also fits in here
	must be able to be controlled by mod commands and other modules

allow commands to be targeted to specific freqs (using nmefreq
messages). this probably requires changes to the command interface.

the config manager has to monitor config files for changes. it also
needs some interface to inform clients when changes occur. there should
be sufficiently fine granularity that the whole server doesn't need to
stop and re-read settings every time someone touches a file, but it
shouldn't be so fine that it's a pain in the ass to use.

the config manager also needs a way to change settings in memory AND
also write those updates back to disk, so that they aren't lost in a
recycle or crash.

fix flag drops at edges

fix brick drop algorithm (it should snap to edges of other bricks)

implement emulation for ekted's bots.


hard

"rotating" packet structure: a grouped packet full of rels should become
a single rel packet containing a group of unrels. the tricks here is
to remove the individual packets that get grouped and add the new one to
the outlist.
