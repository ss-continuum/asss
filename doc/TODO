easy
----
log filtering


moderate
--------
sound messages

points_goal

lag handling

better pre-processor for config

banners

message limiting:
	shutup
	lock{private,public,team,chat}

locking. lots of options here:
	lock to freq
	lock to ship
	lock only certain people
	finite "lives" also fits in here
	must be able to be controlled by mod commands and other modules


hard
----
bandwith limiting and prioritization

tinyscheme interface

python interface?


currently broken
----------------
turret kicking

ball sync


misc
----
arenas:
persistant arena names for ?arena
permissions to enter certain arenas
*go command

balls:
region-based goals. 3/6-team ball games.
let ball speccer see info of person carrying ball.
multiple-point goals based on distance

add to configguide.txt

more querying about stats:
	lots of stuff from net
	also from modules

loading/unloading modules at runtime!

treat nme bricks as tiles for the purposes of dropping bricks

come up with better interface to other languages (python, and others)




bandwidth
---------
bandwidth limiting should have these abilities:
  don't send more than x bytes per second to a given player, averaged
  over a configurable amount of time. that is, don't do the averaging
  over the whole session, because it won't be accurate. and don't do it
  over 1/100 of a second for the same reason (is this true?). one second
  is probably good.

  add a new flag to the SendToX interface to send immediately anyway,
  even if it's over the limit.

  ability to prioritize packets (even two priorities would be helpful)
  so we can make sure to send lots of weapons now, even if the player
  happens to be downloading a file at the moment.

  later, automatically adjust player's bandwidth limits based on
  packetloss stats.



discarded ideas
---------------
sort data entries by key so matching keys on read is faster
   even if there are 20 types of persistant data (which I don't even
   expect), linear search is fast enough.

implement the suggestion that other arenas only have to supply settings
that override main arena's. this has potentially large consequences.
	a better idea is to have those arenas #include config files from the
	default. this gives people better control at the expense of a tiny
	bit more work. and i've now improved include to allow relative
	paths, so it should be even easier.
