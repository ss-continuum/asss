per-arena
---------
ok, per-arena callbacks are good to go. what about interfaces?

log
---
add filtering capability


game
----
attaching, detaching, speccing should be working perfectly soon


flag/ball
---------
do it


capman
------
yes, that's the name. do it.
better authority model (groups, capabilities)
  write about it first!


net
---
bandwidth limiting feature. should have these abilities:
  don't send more than x bytes per second to a given player, averaged
  over a configurable amount of time. that is, don't do the averaging
  over the whole session, because it won't be accurate. and don't do it
  over 1/100 of a second for the same reason (is this true?). one second
  is probably good.

  add a new flag to the SendToX interface to send immediately anyway,
  even if it's over the limit.

  ability to prioritize packets (even two priorities would be helpful)
  so we can make sure to send lots of weapons now, even if the player
  happens to be downloading a file at the moment.

  later, automatically adjust player's bandwidth limits based on
  packetloss stats.

latency/ploss handling


persist
-------


config
------
maybe use a real parser engine and scrap my ugly code?

better pre-processor.


arenaman
--------
persistant arena names for ?arena


out-of-process extensions
-------------------------
come up with better interface to other languages (python, and others)


banner
------
do it


mapdata/bricks
-------
do them


discarded ideas
---------------
sort data entries by key so matching keys on read is faster
   even if there are 20 types of persistant data (which I don't even
   expect), linear search is fast enough.

implement the suggestion that other arenas only have to supply settings
that override main arena's. this has potentially large consequences.
	a better idea is to have those arenas #include config files from the
	default. this gives people better control at the expense of a tiny
	bit more work. and i've now improved include to allow relative
	paths, so it should be even easier.


really really super long-term
-----------------------------
