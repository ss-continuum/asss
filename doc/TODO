short term
----------

redo a bit of logging to use classes

more game stuff

persistant arena names for ?arena

work on more modules, in roughly this order:
game/flag/ball, etc.

better authority model (groups, capabilities)
  write about it first!


net
---
does my implementation of acking (the lastack thing) really work?!
fix it!
and make outgoing queues separate per player.


persist
-------
sort data entries by key so matching keys on read is faster

sync every x seconds (implement in db loop with gtc())


config
------
implement the suggestion that other arenas only have to supply settings
that override main arena's. this has potentially large consequences.


long term
---------

come up with better interface to other languages (python, and others)

make an array for "connection titles" in Inet and have core set them
  so net doesn't require core and can be used unchanged for billcore

make banner plugin (wait until billing server stuff working, because
  it gets banners from biller)

make module that contains map data for arenas

make brick module that uses map data module

latency/ploss handling
