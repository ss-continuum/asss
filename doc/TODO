per-arena
---------
think really hard about how to make per-arena interfaces and things work
nicely.


log
---
redo a bit of logging to use classes


game
----
attaching, detaching, speccing should be working perfectly soon


flag/ball
---------
do it


capman
------
yes, that's the name. do it.
better authority model (groups, capabilities)
  write about it first!


net
---
does my implementation of acking (the lastack thing) really work?!  fix it!
and make outgoing queues separate per player. (these go together)

latency/ploss handling


persist
-------


config
------
implement the suggestion that other arenas only have to supply settings
that override main arena's. this has potentially large consequences.


arenaman
--------
persistant arena names for ?arena


out-of-process extensions
-------------------------
come up with better interface to other languages (python, and others)


banner
------
do it


mapdata/bricks
-------
do them


discarded ideas
---------------
sort data entries by key so matching keys on read is faster
   even if there are 20 types of persistant data (which I don't even
   expect), linear search is fast enough.


really really super long-term
-----------------------------
