short term
----------

think hard about threading

implement some threading

separate core into:
  arenaman - uses new threading
  logon
  mapnewsdl



long term
---------

add a tiny bit more threading: a separate thread for unreliable packets
  might make sense. keep security in mind: don't let arbitrary packets
  be processed in the other thread without sufficient locking. possibly
  restrict to certain packet types.

make an array for "connection titles" in Inet and have core set them
  so net doesn't require core and can be used unchanged for billcore

make banner plugin (wait until billing server stuff working, because
  it gets banners from biller)

make module that contains map data for arenas

make brick module that uses map data module

work on net so that it's easy to simulate players. preferably be able
  to simulate them without sending artificial login packet

fix map compression!

get module loading/unloading during run working

module dependencies?

dynamic extension!



done
----

some nice way to make client-side settings packet: #include
  it's not perfect, but it's the best I can think of for now

get rid of crashes from using arenas[-1] (i hope)

deciphered client settings packet! woo!

restructured big chunks of the internals so it's even more modular and
  extendable than before, if such a thing is possible

begun work on billing server protocol. it looks easier than I thought,
  so minimal billing server support might be in here sooner than I
  expected.
