can i ask you a question?
(divine.216)>sure
::in the hypothetical case that i was rewriting the ss server, what kinda
features would you want it to have? i mean, what are the biggest
problems/missing things from the regular server?
(divine.216)>alot of little things (subgame.log deleting on recycle, pretty
much defeats the purpose)
(divine.216)>hmm
(divine.216)>oh ya
Type ?arena for a list of active subarenas. Try ?go funspace for our resident
super zone or ?go bomberman for a unique, wacked-out Turf variant.
(divine.216)>that bug with sub arena recycle forcing the sub arena's scores
to be the players pub scores
::well, that's good.(divine.216)>not sure if that is your thing or billing
the little things are probably the easiest to fix
::i don't know aobut that bug, but i'm guessing it(divine.216)>also, it'd be
nice if we could add/remove mods and smods inside the game... instead of
logging into ftp or getfile and editing the mod/smod.txt
would be in subgame, not the biller
(divine.216)>that might not be something to change though, i'm not sure if
that is the whole idea of the .txt's so that its mroe difficult to add
::anything more ambitious? e.g., server-side plugins to eliminate the need
for bots(divine.216)>i'll think of a bunch more...

Drop those flags in a base and guard them like a sissy for big periodic
rewards, or fly with them and enjoy the kill multiplier.
(divine.216)>well of course...                                              
(divine.216)>i'd thought about maybe allowing for something like a built in
web server...
(divine.216)>that'd let you define a few files to be displayed if the ip/port
is called
(divine.216)>but that might not be a good idea
(divine.216)>also..
(divine.216)>maybe the have another port (like the port+1) that'd pipe out
alot more game stats

questions and comments specific to the SCF, send email to einexile@west.net
(divine.216)>it seems like you could basically include something that would
use an api like yours or ekteys... maybe not so much msg related... but have
another key that would designate msgs to the bot (like ? and * but maybe
&COMMAND)
::the way i'm thinking about it now, the plugins wouldn't be separate things,
they'd appear to be part of the server. so they'd use regular *commands. in
fact, the standard game types (wz, rz, pb, turf, etc) will be plugins
(divine.216)>it would also be nice to have a way to use a simple scripting
language in the settings, but i'm not sure if that would involve a client

loading plugins will be limited to sysops (or whoever they give the power
too). it's a question of allowing people to see the api's
(divine.216)>because it will probably spell out alot of the packet structure?
::right. it's going to be a low level as possible to give the plugins the
most flexibility. but there's no reason why i couldn't also write a layer
that would insulate ppl from the raw packets...
::which would make security concerns a bit less important
(divine.216)>i guess it depends who you hvae to convince... because your
going to have to convince some people that may not understand how it works

i've come to see that it plays a role

(divine.216)>good, it'll be more fun that way for you, you probably will be
able to convince yourself to work on it easier then
(divine.216)>when i first started doing things for/with ss, i would sit there
and smack myself because i was only doing it because i thought it'd
contribute to the game...
(divine.216)>but thats not enough to keep yourself interested

you could have a built in msg board for  staff so that we could leave each
