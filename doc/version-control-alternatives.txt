cvs sucks. what else can we use?

subversion:
	pro:
		most popular
		good windows support
		closest to cvs
	con:
		centralized

darcs:
	pro:
		distributed
		conceptually extremely simple/easy to use
		good email support
		great support for cherry-picking
	con:
		questionable windows support/no gui
		each repository is a single line

monotone:
	pro:
		distributed
		i like the design
		built-in crypto
		might support one public repo that i can cherry-pick
			changes from, and maintain my own secure line within
	con:
		dependence on crypto, possibly harder to use
		not good support for cherry-picking
		questionable windows support/no gui

arch:
	pro:
		distributed
		good support for cherry-picking
		merge operators?
	con:
		hard to learn
		horrid windows support
