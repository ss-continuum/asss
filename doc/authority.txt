we need a better system to replace mod/smod/sysop. it should be based on
capabilities. there will be a capability manager, 'capman'. other
modules will ask it to determine if a player has a given capability.

possible capabilities:
see log messages from the log_sysop module
see priv freqs
see priv arenas
for each command:
	use command with target arena
	use command with target person/freq

the standard capability manager will:
	have group definitions in a groups.conf file.
	have group membership information stored per arena.
	  OR
	have groups contain the arenas they are valid in.
