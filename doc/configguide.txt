ENERGY / EXTRA POSITION DATA
----------------------------

There are two arena settings that control whether players see other
player's energy and ship inventory (from spec):

Misc:SpecSeeEnergy
  This affects what players in spec see. If it's set to SEE_ALL, a
  player will see inventory/energy for the player he is speccing, plus
  energy for all other players. If it's SEE_SPEC, a player will only see
  energy/inventory for the player he is speccing. SEE_NONE will disable
  all extra information for speccers.

Misc:SeeEnergy
  If this is set to SEE_ALL, everyone will see everyone else's energy.
  If it's SEE_TEAM, you will only see the energy of your teammates. If
  it's SEE_NONE, no one will see other's energy.

In addition, there are two capabilities that override the above
settings. "seeepd" allows players to see energy/inventory from spec, and
"seenrg" allows energy viewing while playing.
